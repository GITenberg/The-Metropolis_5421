description: With the same outraged sensibility that fueled his muckraking expos The
  Jungle , Sinclair turns a gimlet eye upon the jaded lifestyles of New York City's
  high society in this 1907 novel. Freshly arrived from Mississippi, young lawyer
  Allan Montague is swept up in a profligate atmosphere of party-going and excess
  that soon threatens to destroy him.
